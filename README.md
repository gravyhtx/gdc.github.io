# Gravy Design Co. Website (v2.1)

This website was made using Bootstrap, utilizing several of it's features. HTML5 and CSS are primarily used for coding.


CODE

The NavBar is one of the first key elements used from Bootstrap. Click on the logo will always bring user back to home page. Hover effects over each other page name and all link to separate .html files in the source code.

The source code is structured for easy access to files. All HTML files are in the main repository while CSS and image assets are all stored in the "assets" folder.

All images including logo are made bt Gr√§vy Design Co. and subject to copyright.

The portfolio page uses the Bootstrap sticky footer while all otherr pages use HTML to display copyright info.

The "about" page features layout examples using Bootstrap grid features. Bootstrap is used exclusively on the "contact" page where it is just a NavBar and Contact Form from Bootstrap code. It is encapsulated in a "jumbotron" which CSS manipulates the opacity as to not completely obscure the masterpiece of a background behind it.


DESIGN

Layouts are all meant to be interesting, and hopefully are. They all are meant to draw the user's attention in a nice flow with the background image. The home page proudly displays the full effect of the background mannequin heads on PC browsers, with a newly designed image to the left underneath out slogan "design for a better you". As the screen size shinks so does this image. You will notice on mobile versions that the mountains to the left are much more pronounced as a background element while PC users will get to see the full glory of the background.

You will notice some key features throughout. Some are more consistent than others. Primarily, the company's font, "Poppins", is used throughout the entire website. Many titles are in all lower-case. And, when it looks aesthetically pleasing, two backslashes [ // ] are used as dividers and sometimes to begin a list (instead of dashes/dots/numbers/etc.)


FUTURE ADDITIONS

This site will continue to be edited. Lorem Ipsum text will be replaced with actual text.  The "portfolio" page will display links to project pages, possibly with thumbnails. The "contact" page will likely have links below the form with social media accounts. Annnnd any bugs not yet caught will be sorted out!
