                Grävy Design Co. was established in January 2019 by (creative director/owner) Andrew Richard. 
                Before starting his company, Andrew spent over a decade perfecting and broadening his skills in just about every conceivable creative industry.
                His passion for technology arts began in college where he studied audio production, analog electronics, and music marketing at the Art Institute of Houston.
                During that time he took classes in graphic design and computer programming which lead to a lifelong goal of learning and implementing all aspects of the modern creative industry.
                His job in technology took him to Asheville, NC where he worked at a local Apple store, working his way from sales, to teaching OS/iOS classes, and finally 
                becoming the store manager. He was soon able to develop the technical and interpersonal skills that offered a foundation for the rest of his career.
                After moving back to Houston, he continued his pursuit of music production and DJing while expanding his talents in graphic design. This lead to some new 
                opportunities with a newfound passion for design, working in apparel and digital print. Since then he has been steadily rising as a top designer in Houston. 
                Having had extensive experience working with with many well known corporate and local clients, he started this company. It took off lightning fast 
                after being commissioned to design album art for nationally signed artists. Since then Grävy Design Co. has worked with Houston rap legends on art and 
                music videos, created websites for corporate and small businesses, and designed products and apparels for for an ever-expanding list of clients.
                Andrew is currently pursuing his career as a lifelong student at Rice University, continually expanding and perfecting his talents 
                for the greater good of humanity.
